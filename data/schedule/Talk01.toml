description = "Data storytelling can be posited as the last ten feet of any data analysis and arguably the most important aspect. Your ability to break down your work articulately to various audiences who are looking for marginally or substantially differently packaged outputs for decision making is key. This is the only true value of data analysis to your audience. Based on his experience in both B2C (Agency) and internal analytics teams, Kamande highlights the importance of a stakeholder audience matrix and building up from this in data storytelling for maximum data science value creation."
