description = "In almost every industry these days, huge volume of data is generated at a high velocity. Data is by without dispute, the main building block for scientific inquiry, decision-making and product design; and as such, efficient data management practices become as critical as the generating processes in order to benefit in getting useful insights. Data management is a combination of activities and processes applied to the raw data by means of processing, curating and archiving the final clean flat files for use in an analysis. In this talk, I am going to walk you through a step-by-step process in managing and cleaning your data using R programming language. I will also share some tricks on how to efficiently deal with huge volume of data in the context of data management."
