description = "In this workshop, we will explore how modules can help us better manage Shiny apps when they become a bit large and/or complex. We will develop a simple dashboard with maps, graphics and some simple statistical models/analysis (if time allows). We will be using data from the {rKenyaCensus} R library developed by Shel Kariuki, which can be installed by running the following code in R: devtools::install_github('Shelmith-Kariuki/rKenyaCensus').The workshop will build on a number of R libraries such as {leaflet}, {sf}, {data.table}, {plotly}, {ggplot2} and of course {shiny}. We will use {shiny.react}, {shiny.router} and {shiny.fluent}, which are all developed by the amazing team at Appsilon (appsilon.com). For more information and installation instructions, have a look at https://github.com/Appsilon. The workshop requires some experience with the development of Shiny apps and general experience with R Statistics, including functions. We will develop a simple dashboard live as part of the session, so participants will need a stable internet connection to be able to follow along."

bio = "Tor-Gunnar Vågen is a Principal Scientist and head of the Spatial Data Science and Applied Learning Lab (SPACIAL) at CIFOR-ICRAF. He has a background in soil science, hydrology, landscape ecology, statistical modeling, computer programming, and remote sensing (earth observation). He currently leads research initiatives to establish global data-driven networks of sites for comparative assessments of ecosystem health, linking earth observation data and models to biophysical and socio-economic variables to understand drivers of deforestation, land use change and land degradation, and land restoration potential. He has also been leading several projects and initiatives that explore spatial data science and user-centered design principles in the co-design of interactive tools and platforms for evidence-based decision making."
