description = "Visualizing data is the necessary stage of data exploration that can routinely protect from embarrassing errors. As modern tools place data visualization in the focus of research workflows the need to visualize data is gaining increasing recognition among researchers. However, impressive and efficient graphics are quite rare in the ever-growing universe of dry academic texts. Many of the bad graphical design choices are justified by nothing but the suboptimal defaults and various software legacy issues and mostly outdated limitations imposed by traditional scientific publishers. In this talk I will focus on simple and powerful design choices that help uncover your data and tell your story."
