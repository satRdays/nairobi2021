The project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, with an emphasis placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with R and various packages within the tidyverse ecosystem. This workshop will cover the steps taken to participate and the benefits and goals achieved in the process. The workshop will also highlight the welcoming inclusive and online community with the help of the hashtag on Twitter with an emphasis on learning or expanding oneâ€™s skill set through different data projects posted weekly."
